## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Imported distance-measurement datasource
The system SHALL allow the heatmap alignment GUI to import a generated peak-distance JSON file as an optional datasource alongside the camera video and H5 heatmap recording.

#### Scenario: Import peak-distance JSON
- **WHEN** the user imports a peak-distance JSON file generated from a recorded H5 log
- **THEN** the system loads the distance measurements as an optional datasource without replacing the camera video or H5 heatmap track

#### Scenario: Load peak-distance JSON on startup
- **WHEN** the user launches the heatmap alignment GUI with a peak-distance JSON startup argument
- **THEN** the system loads that file as the optional distance-measurement datasource during startup

#### Scenario: Load H5 and peak-distance JSON on startup
- **WHEN** the user launches the heatmap alignment GUI with both H5 recording and peak-distance JSON startup arguments
- **THEN** the system loads the H5 recording and validates the peak-distance datasource against it using the same import rules as interactive import

#### Scenario: Load session and peak-distance JSON on startup
- **WHEN** the user launches the heatmap alignment GUI with both a saved alignment session and a peak-distance JSON startup argument
- **THEN** the explicitly provided peak-distance JSON replaces any peak-distance datasource stored in the loaded session after validation

#### Scenario: Validate imported datasource metadata
- **WHEN** the imported peak-distance JSON contains source-selection metadata
- **THEN** the system compares that metadata with the loaded H5 heatmap track when one is present and warns the user if the source selection appears incompatible

#### Scenario: Reject incompatible row count
- **WHEN** the imported peak-distance JSON has a different number of measurement objects than the loaded H5 heatmap recording has frames
- **THEN** the system rejects the import and leaves the current peak-distance datasource unchanged

#### Scenario: Validate real-time axis
- **WHEN** the imported peak-distance JSON contains elapsed real-time seconds
- **THEN** the system verifies that the imported time range is compatible with the loaded H5 heatmap recording duration when one is present

#### Scenario: Preserve timeline rows
- **WHEN** the imported peak-distance JSON contains frames with no detection
- **THEN** the system preserves those rows so the imported datasource remains aligned to the source recording timeline

#### Scenario: Reject reduced CSV as datasource
- **WHEN** the user attempts to import a reduced CSV peak-distance export as the heatmap alignment datasource
- **THEN** the system rejects it and asks for the canonical JSON peak-distance export

#### Scenario: Report invalid peak-distance JSON
- **WHEN** the user imports a JSON file that is not a canonical peak-distance JSON export
- **THEN** the system reports a user-oriented error message that identifies the file as an invalid peak-distance JSON file and presents technical parser details only as secondary context

#### Scenario: Toggle peak visualization
- **WHEN** an imported peak-distance datasource is loaded
- **THEN** the system allows the user to show or hide its visualization without unloading the datasource

#### Scenario: Unload peak datasource
- **WHEN** the user clears or unloads the imported peak-distance datasource
- **THEN** the system removes the imported peak measurements from the current session without changing the camera video or H5 heatmap track

#### Scenario: Load session without imported datasource
- **WHEN** the user loads an alignment session that does not contain an imported distance-measurement datasource
- **THEN** the system treats the datasource as absent and loads the existing camera and heatmap state normally

### Requirement: Peak-distance visualization
The system SHALL provide a lightweight visualization for an imported peak-distance datasource in the heatmap alignment GUI.

#### Scenario: Render current peak on heatmap
- **WHEN** an imported peak-distance datasource is visible and the current H5 frame has a detected peak
- **THEN** the system renders a marker for that peak at its measured distance on or alongside the current heatmap view

#### Scenario: Hide peak visualization
- **WHEN** the user hides the imported peak-distance datasource
- **THEN** the system stops rendering peak-distance markers or plots while keeping the imported datasource available in the session

#### Scenario: Handle no-detection frame in visualization
- **WHEN** an imported peak-distance datasource is visible and the current H5 frame has no detection
- **THEN** the system indicates the absence of a peak without drawing a misleading distance marker

#### Scenario: Export visible peak marker
- **WHEN** an imported peak-distance datasource is visible and the user exports a synced video with a heatmap overlay
- **THEN** the exported heatmap overlay includes the detected peak marker for each output frame that maps to a detected H5 peak row

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Alignment session persistence
The system SHALL save and load JSON alignment session files containing the state needed to reproduce a manual alignment session, including any optional imported distance-measurement datasource.

#### Scenario: Save alignment session
- **WHEN** the user saves an alignment session
- **THEN** the system writes source paths, selected H5 session/group/entry/subsweep, render color limits, camera viewport corners, viewport output dimensions, export overlay settings, temporal offset in seconds, preprocessing settings, and optional imported distance-measurement datasource metadata to JSON

#### Scenario: Load alignment session
- **WHEN** the user loads a saved alignment session
- **THEN** the system restores the source selections, viewport geometry, render settings, temporal offset, preview state, and optional imported distance-measurement datasource metadata described by the session file
