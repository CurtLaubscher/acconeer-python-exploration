## Purpose

Provide a standalone workbench for manually aligning one camera video track with one H5-rendered Sparse IQ heatmap track, saving that alignment as a session, and exporting a synced video with a plotted heatmap overlay.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Standalone alignment workbench
The system SHALL provide a standalone PySide6 user tool for aligning one camera video track with one H5-rendered Sparse IQ heatmap track.

#### Scenario: Launch alignment workbench
- **WHEN** the user launches the alignment workbench
- **THEN** the system displays controls for loading a camera video, loading an H5 radar recording, viewing both sources, adjusting alignment, and saving or loading an alignment session

### Requirement: H5 heatmap truth rendering
The system SHALL render the ground-truth heatmap directly from the selected H5 radar recording using the same Sparse IQ distance/velocity map logic used by the existing heatmap video exporter.

#### Scenario: Load H5 recording
- **WHEN** the user loads an H5 radar recording
- **THEN** the system selects the default session, group, entry, and subsweep using exporter-compatible selection behavior and displays a rendered heatmap frame

#### Scenario: Adjust color limits
- **WHEN** the user changes the rendered heatmap color minimum or maximum
- **THEN** the system updates the rendered heatmap preview using the new limits without requiring a pre-rendered heatmap video

### Requirement: Camera viewport definition
The system SHALL allow the user to define one fixed four-corner viewport over the heatmap body visible in the camera video.

#### Scenario: Drag viewport corner
- **WHEN** the user drags a viewport corner in the camera video view
- **THEN** the system updates the viewport quadrilateral and the rectified viewport preview

#### Scenario: Stationary viewport reuse
- **WHEN** the user scrubs to another camera video time
- **THEN** the system applies the same viewport quadrilateral to the new camera frame

### Requirement: Rectified viewport preview
The system SHALL rectify the selected camera viewport to a display resolution suitable for direct visual comparison with the rendered heatmap preview.

#### Scenario: Display comparable previews
- **WHEN** both the camera video and H5 recording are loaded and a viewport is defined
- **THEN** the system displays the rectified camera viewport and rendered heatmap in same-shaped preview regions suitable for manual visual comparison

### Requirement: Shared physical timeline
The system SHALL represent camera video time and H5 heatmap time on a shared timeline measured in physical seconds.

#### Scenario: Scrub shared timeline
- **WHEN** the user moves the current-time marker on the timeline
- **THEN** the system updates the camera video frame, rectified viewport frame, and rendered heatmap frame for the corresponding aligned times

#### Scenario: Adjust temporal offset
- **WHEN** the user drags a track or uses nudge controls to change alignment
- **THEN** the system updates the stored camera-to-H5 offset in seconds and refreshes the displayed previews

#### Scenario: View track placement
- **WHEN** both the camera video and H5 heatmap are loaded
- **THEN** the system displays compact horizontal duration bars on a shared seconds axis, with the H5 heatmap as the fixed reference track and the camera video as the draggable alignment track

#### Scenario: Drag camera track
- **WHEN** the user drags the camera duration bar horizontally
- **THEN** the system updates the stored camera-to-H5 offset and refreshes the displayed previews while keeping the H5 bar fixed

### Requirement: Manual playback preview
The system SHALL provide basic playback controls for previewing the aligned camera video and rendered heatmap together without requiring MVP audio playback.

#### Scenario: Play aligned tracks
- **WHEN** the user starts playback
- **THEN** the system advances the shared current time according to elapsed physical time and updates the camera, rectified viewport, and rendered heatmap previews according to the current offset

#### Scenario: Slow preview refresh
- **WHEN** preview rendering cannot keep up with every source frame
- **THEN** the system skips displayed frames as needed rather than slowing the shared playback clock

### Requirement: Disposable GUI preview proxy
The system SHALL be allowed to use a disposable local preview proxy for camera playback and scrubbing, while keeping alignment session files pointed at the original camera-video path.

#### Scenario: Load large camera video for GUI preview
- **WHEN** the user loads a camera video whose native resolution is higher than the GUI preview target
- **THEN** the system may generate or reuse a local preview proxy for GUI playback and scrubbing instead of decoding the original source directly on each preview refresh

#### Scenario: Save session after proxy-backed preview
- **WHEN** the user saves an alignment session after working against a preview proxy
- **THEN** the session file stores the original camera-video path rather than the disposable local proxy path

### Requirement: Xcorr diagnostic placeholder
The system SHALL defer xcorr diagnostics in the MVP and SHALL NOT run expensive xcorr computation during source load or normal manual preview interaction.

#### Scenario: Load sources without xcorr
- **WHEN** the user loads a camera video or H5 recording
- **THEN** the system does not run cross-correlation automatically

#### Scenario: Preserve manual alignment authority
- **WHEN** the xcorr diagnostic has a peak at a different lag than the current offset
- **THEN** the system does not change the current offset unless the user manually adjusts it

### Requirement: Alignment session persistence
The system SHALL save and load JSON alignment session files containing the state needed to reproduce a manual alignment session.

#### Scenario: Save alignment session
- **WHEN** the user saves an alignment session
- **THEN** the system writes source paths, selected H5 session/group/entry/subsweep, render color limits, camera viewport corners, viewport output dimensions, export overlay settings, temporal offset in seconds, and preprocessing settings to JSON

#### Scenario: Load alignment session
- **WHEN** the user loads a saved alignment session
- **THEN** the system restores the source selections, viewport geometry, render settings, temporal offset, and preview state described by the session file

### Requirement: Synced video export overlay
The system SHALL let the user place a rectangular export overlay on the camera preview and use it to export a synced video with an H5 heatmap plot composited onto original-resolution camera footage.

#### Scenario: Adjust export overlay
- **WHEN** the user drags the export overlay center, edge, or corner on the camera preview
- **THEN** the system updates the preview-space overlay rectangle by moving it, resizing one dimension, or resizing both dimensions respectively

#### Scenario: Toggle export overlay visibility
- **WHEN** the user toggles export overlay visibility from the camera preview context menu
- **THEN** the system shows or hides the overlay controls and does not render the overlay preview while the overlay is hidden

#### Scenario: Preview export overlay content
- **WHEN** the export overlay and overlay preview are visible
- **THEN** the system renders a low-quality plotted H5 heatmap with axes inside the overlay rectangle on top of the camera preview

#### Scenario: Export synced video
- **WHEN** the user exports a synced video
- **THEN** the system writes an MP4 for exactly the H5 recording duration, using the higher of camera FPS and H5 FPS, original-resolution camera frames, the H5 frame at each output time, and a plotted H5 heatmap composited into the scaled export overlay rectangle

#### Scenario: Export outside camera coverage
- **WHEN** the H5 output time maps before the first camera frame or after the last camera frame using the current offset
- **THEN** the system holds the closest first or last camera frame while continuing to render the H5 overlay for that output time

#### Scenario: Show export progress
- **WHEN** synced video export is running
- **THEN** the system shows a busy/progress state and prevents starting a second export simultaneously

### Requirement: Extensible track model
The system SHALL structure alignment state so the MVP's camera video and H5 heatmap are represented as tracks on a shared timeline.

#### Scenario: Persist MVP tracks
- **WHEN** the system saves an alignment session
- **THEN** the session file represents the camera video and H5 heatmap as distinct tracks with their source configuration and timing state
